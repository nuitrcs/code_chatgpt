# Solutions to the exercises

## Exercise 1 (food research)

Generally, you want to breakdown broad problems into specific tasks. ChatGPT is more useful for specific tasks. (You can also try asking ChatGPT to help you breakdown a problem into specific tasks.) This was key for this exercise. The first question could even be "How do I read a dataset hosted on GitHub in Python/R/etc.?"

You can find a possible solution to the exercise in Python [here](https://github.com/nuitrcs/PythonPuzzleParty/blob/main/answers/2_CulinaryResearch.ipynb).

## Exercise 2 (rock, paper, scissors)

Below is an example conversation with ChatGPT for solving this problem. It got quite lengthy, however, it was important to understand why it was giving errors and guide it through the process of solving it.

The process reflected here should help you with your more realistic research scenarios.

Pay attention to how summarizing its own knowledge in the form of a table helped it correct the code implementation.
