PART 1:
You will face an opponent in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, which will last for several rounds. You find a strategy guide for winning. The strategy guide consists of two columns. The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors.​

You are not sure what the second column means, but you reason it must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors.​
​
Your total score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).


PART 2:
Turns out the second column says how the round needs to end: X means you need to lose, Y means you need to end the round in a draw, and Z means you need to win.​
​
The total score is still calculated in the same way, but now you need to figure out what shape to choose so the round ends as indicated.
