<b>PART 1:</b>

You will face an opponent in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, which will last for several rounds. You find a strategy guide for winning. The strategy guide consists of two columns. The first column is what your opponent is going to play: A for Rock, B for Paper, and C for Scissors. You are not sure what the second column means, but you reason it must be what you should play in response: X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors. Your total score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won). For example, suppose you were given the following strategy guide:​

A Y​
B X​
C Z​

This strategy guide predicts and recommends the following: In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you should choose Paper (Y). This ends in a win for you with a score of 8 (2 because you chose Paper + 6 because you won). In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you should choose Rock (X). This ends in a loss for you with a score of 1 (1 + 0). The third round is a draw with both players choosing Scissors, giving you a score of 3 + 3 = 6. In this example, if you were to follow the strategy guide, you would get a total score of 15 (8 + 1 + 6).

<b>PART 2:</b>

Turns out the second column says how the round needs to end: X means you need to lose, Y means you need to end the round in a draw, and Z means you need to win. The total score is still calculated in the same way, but now you need to figure out what shape to choose so the round ends as indicated.​
​
The example above now goes like this: In the first round, your opponent will choose Rock (A), and you need the round to end in a draw (Y), so you also choose Rock. This gives you a score of 1 + 3 = 4. In the second round, your opponent will choose Paper (B), and you choose Rock so you lose (X) with a score of 1 + 0 = 1. In the third round, you will defeat your opponent's Scissors with Rock for a score of 1 + 6 = 7.​
​
Now that you're correctly decrypting the secret strategy guide, you would get a total score of 12.
